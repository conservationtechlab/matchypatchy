<h1 id="bounding-box-">Bounding Box <a name="bounding-box"></a></h1>
<p>The coordinates of a rectangle that define an ROI within an image.
The coordinates are relative to the size of the image (between 0 and 1) 
and are given as:
bbox_x - the x coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle
bbox_y - the y coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle
bbox_w - the width of the box as a proportion of the whole image
bbox_h - the height of the box as a proportion of the whole image</p>

<h1 id="camera-">Camera <a name="camera"></a></h1>
<p>A physical camera trap device deployed at a Station.</p>

<h1 id="capture-">Capture <a name="capture"></a></h1>

<h1 id="detector-">Detector <a name="detector"></a></h1>
<p>A machine-learning model that is capable of detecting the animals in raw camera trap images (e.g. MegaDetector).</p>

<h1 id="distance-metric-">Distance Metric <a name="distance-metric"></a></h1>
<p>A method for quantifying the dissimilarity of two vectors.</p>

<h2 id="cosine-distance">Cosine Distance</h2>
<p>The cosine of the angle between the vectors, or the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their lengths.</p>

<h2 id="l2-distance">L2 Distance</h2>
<p>Also known as the Euclidean distance, the straight-line distance between two vectors in n-dimensional space.</p>

<h2 id="distance-threshold-">Distance Threshold <a name="distance-threshold"></a></h2>
<p>The upper-bound of the chosen distance metric that will include an image in the match stack
as a potential match when its distance to the query image is below the threshold.</p>

<h1 id="embedding-">Embedding <a name="embedding"></a></h1>
<p>The output of the re-identification model that describes the image as a single vector.</p>

<h1 id="individual-">Individual <a name="individual"></a></h1>
<p>A single, distinct, self-contained living entity. An individual can be given a name,
and has attributes sex and age at a given point in time.</p>

<h1 id="model-">Model <a name="model"></a></h1>
<p>In machine learning, a complex algorithm that transforms data of one kind (e.g. a .png image)
into another kind (e.g. a 2,180-point vector) after learning patterns of associations through 
many examples.</p>

<h1 id="region-">Region <a name="region"></a></h1>
<p>A geographical region that may host one or more Surveys (e.g. “Northest Peru”).</p>

<h1 id="roi-">ROI <a name="roi"></a></h1>
<p>A “Region of Interest” within an image that is defined by a bounding box and typically contains
an animal and minimal background.</p>

<h1 id="sequence-">Sequence <a name="sequence"></a></h1>
<p>A set of images taken in quick succession at a specific location.
A sequence can also refer to the frames of a video.</p>

<h1 id="station-">Station <a name="station"></a></h1>
<p>A specific location within the geological bounds of a Survey that contains one or more camera traps.</p>

<h1 id="survey-">Survey <a name="survey"></a></h1>
<p>A camera trap study in a particular geographical Region over a specific period of time
that encompasses a set of cameras at specific Station locations.</p>

<h1 id="viewpoint-">Viewpoint <a name="viewpoint"></a></h1>
<p>The visible side of the animal’s body in an image as seen from the camera.</p>
